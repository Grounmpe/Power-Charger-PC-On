# Power-Charger-PC-On

The code for this project is provided as is. It is up to the user to know what to change in the code for it to work on your project. What I have in my code is what works for my specific project. 

The project uses wireless charger with an input voltage of 5 to 12 that is slightly modified to be wired to a generic Arduino Nano. The  generic Arduino Nano is coded to act like a switch to send a "signal" to the pins for turning on a PC. 

This project has no corporate sponsors. The Arduino forums were used for code help. I thank the users who commented on that specific post in the Arduino forums.
