# Power-Charger-PC-On

The code for this project is provided as is. It is up to the user to know what to change in the code for it to work on your project. What I have in my code is what works for my specific project. 

The project uses a wireless charger with an input voltage of 5V to 12V that is slightly modified to be wired to a generic Arduino Nano. The  generic Arduino Nano is coded to act like a switch to send a "signal" to the pins for turning on a PC. 

This project has no corporate sponsors. The Arduino forums were used for code help. I thank the users who commented on that specific post in the Arduino forums.

My personal commentary: 
The project is entirely open source. I do not care what you do with the knowledge from this project. If it ever happens, I want to see this product be made for PC cases. If your conscience is unsettled even after I share this with the world. Reference my GitHub username, Grounmpe, to give credit where it is due is all I ask and nothing more. I made this because I wanted to turn my computer on and charge my smartphone. I have an iPhone (disclaimer: this project is not sponsored by Apple) that can charge wirelessly. Convenience at best. This works well, but I don't have a reset button when I do need it and one thing I did not include in the wiring diagram for this project.
